# Novel-X supplementary data

This repository contains data that didn't show up in "Novel sequence insertion detection using Linked-Reads" paper. It is not structured at the moment but will be.

### Simulated dataset

Folder simulation contains various scripts we used to obtain results for the "Simulated dataset" section:

* ... - script for creating reference with insertions, given list of insertions and reference.
* ... - commands used to simulated reads and bam-file
* ... - list of insertions used (borrowed from Huddlestone et al, 2015)
* ...vcf - list of insertions found
